# Planetary Computer SDK for Python

Python library for interacting with the Microsoft Planetary Computer.

## Installation

```python
pip install planetary-computer
```

If you have an API subscription key, you may provide it to the library by using the included configuration CLI:

```bash
planetarycomputer configure
```

Alternatively, a subscription key may be provided by specifying it in the `PC_SDK_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` environment variable. A subcription key is not required for interacting with the service, however having one in place allows for less restricted rate limiting.


## Development

The following steps may be followed in order to develop locally:

```bash
## Create and activate venv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

## Install requirements
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

## Install locally
pip install -e .

## Format code
./scripts/format

## Run tests
./scripts/test
```


## Usage

This library currently assists with signing Azure Blob Storage URLs, both within PySTAC assets, and by providing raw URLs. The following examples demonstrate both of these use cases:

```python
import pystac
import planetary_computer as pc

raw_item: pystac.Item = ...
item: pystac.Item = pc.sign_assets(raw_item)

# Now use the item however you want. All appropriate assets are signed for read access.
```

```python
import planetary_computer as pc
import pystac

item: pystac.Item = ...  # Landsat item

b4_href = pc.sign(item.assets['SR_B4'].href)

with rasterio.open(b4_href) as ds:
   ...
```
